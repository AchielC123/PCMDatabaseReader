# 🏁 PCM2024 WorldDB2025 Race Tracker Excel Generator

Generates an Excel file with all cycling races from **PCM2024 WorldDB2025**, grouped by category and sorted by date, including conditional formatting to visually track victories per race.

## 📌 What is this?

This tool creates a **blank track record** for all races included in the WorldDB2025 database for **Pro Cycling Manager 2024**. It’s designed to be used alongside your **Career or Pro Cyclist Mode** save, acting as a personal tracker of which races you’ve won.

With conditional formatting, races with **0 victories are shown in red**, and when you update a cell to **1 or more victories**, the race name highlights **green** — so you can instantly see your progress.

## 🎯 Use Case

This is could be useful if you're trying to:
- Win all **World Tour** races in your save
- Keep a personal log of your achievements across your career
- Simulate a rider’s palmarès or chase after specific goals (e.g. win all Monuments or Grand Tours)

  - All races from the PCM2024 WorldDB2025
  - Grouped by category (e.g., Grand Tours, Monuments, National Championships)
  - Sorted by race date within each category
